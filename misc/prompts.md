I will upload a Javascript file designed to run on NodeJS version 20.9.0 and then show you an error message it generates while running. Please find a fix and show me the repaired function.

The overall task is translating Python code into Javascript to run on NodeJS version 20.9.0. Most of this has already been done but there are still some things to transcode and errors to fix. I will upload the original Python file and the current version of the Javascript and then give you further instructions.

First of all look at the main() function. There are several function calls that haven't been translated, in the lines following :
(Python) make_pages('content/\_index.html', '\_site/index.html',
page_layout, \*\*params)
(Javascript) await this.makePages('content/\_index.html', path.join(siteDir, 'index.html'), pageLayout, params);
Please provide the missing translations.
