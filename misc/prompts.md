I will upload a Javascript file designed to run on NodeJS version 20.9.0 and then show you an error message it generates while running. Please find a fix and show me the repaired function.

---

The overall task is translating Python code into Javascript to run on NodeJS version 20.9.0. Most of this has already been done but there are still some things to transcode and errors to fix. I will upload the original Python file and the current version of the Javascript and then give you further instructions.

First of all look at the main() function. There are several function calls that haven't been translated, in the lines following :
(Python) make_pages('content/\_index.html', '\_site/index.html',
page_layout, \*\*params)
(Javascript) await this.makePages('content/\_index.html', path.join(siteDir, 'index.html'), pageLayout, params);
Please provide the missing translations.

I will upload the latest version of the Javascript file.
I'd like you to analyse this to determine the cause of the error around :

     const files = (await fs.readdir(src))
            .filter(f => fs.statSync(path.join(src, f)).isFile())


The error reported is :

validateFunction(cb, 'cb');
^

TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "cb" argument must be of type function. Received undefined

Here are possible causes of the error, please consider each in turn against the source file. If any matches the situation, please offer a fix. Otherwise advise me how to proceed.

1. fs.readdir is not used correctly with await

2. there are incorrect asynchronous fs calls to methods like fs.readFile, fs.writeFile, fs.readdir etc. Make sure all such methods are either used with await inside an async function or with a valid callback function

3. there is inconsistent use of synchronous and asynchronous calls. Unless there is a good reason not to, favor asynchronous in any suggestion
