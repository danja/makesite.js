<p>phonetic pangrams. A pangram is a sentence or phrase that contains all the letters of the alphabet, at least once. Now, phonetic pangrams are sentences that contain all forty sounds of English i.e. they use all the phonemes, or phones, of English (rather than alphabetic characters).</p>
<p>I use this for the 20 vowels in my dialect: Do cook up more broth, fast, firmer, and let it heat; boil, braise, fry. Now show rare beer cure.</p>
<p>That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog. Look out, I shout, for he&#39;s foiled you again, creating chaos.</p>
<p>Are those shy Eurasian footwear, cowboy chaps, or jolly earthmoving headgear?</p>
<p>The hungry purple dinosaur ate the kind, zingy fox, the jabbering crab, and the mad whale and started vending and quacking.</p>
<p>What you are searching for is a phonemic pangram.
I personally prefer the last (with the addition of &#39;what&#39;, since it contains /ʍ/), since it works well for diaphonemes and thus is dialect-neutral. In this case, I included RP&#39;s vowel length distinction and GA&#39;s rhoticity.
Please note that diaphonemes are marked double, like //ðɪs//, and not /ðɪs/.</p>
<p>Plain text:
The beige hue on the waters of the loch impressed all, including the French queen, before she heard that symphony again, just as what young Arthur wanted.</p>
<p>Broad transcription:
//ðə beɪʒ hjuː ɒn ðə ˈwɔːtəɹz ɒv ðə lɒx ɪmˈpɹɛst ɔːl, ɪnˈkluːdɪŋ ðə fɹɛnʧ kwiːn, bɪˈfɔːɹ ʃiː hɜːɹd ðæt ˈsɪmfəniː əˈgɛn, ʤəst əz ʍɒt jʌŋ ˈɑːɹθəɹ ˈwɒntəd.//</p>
<p>Narrow transcription:
[[ðə beɪʒ çjuː ɒn ðə ˈwɔːtʰəɹ̠z ɒv ðə lɒx ɪmˈpʰɹ̠ʷɛst ɔːɫ, ɪnˈkʰluːdɪŋ ðə fɹ̠ʷɛnʧ kwiːn, bɪˈfɔːɹ̠ ʃiː hɜːɹ̠d ðæt ˈsɪɱfəniː əˈgɛn, ʤəst əz ʍɒt jʌŋ ˈɑːɹ̠θəɹ̠ ˈwɒntəd.]]</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
<p>Edit: Oh, and there is also an IPA Reader, which can read out the IPA aloud for you, in various accents and even languages; it&#39;s fun to use and listen to!</p>
